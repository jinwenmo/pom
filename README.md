# pom
POM stands for Primitives, Operations, Metrics and is a framework built to compute software metrics on PADL models. A paper introducing POM has been published by Zaidi, Guéhéneuc, and Sahraoui and can be used as reference. Metrics can be a several kinds: 

* Unary or binary, depending on whether they take as input one or two IFirstClassEntity(ies);
* Context dependent or independent, depending on whether they can be computed by considering given IFirstClassEntity(ies) independently of the rest of the model.
